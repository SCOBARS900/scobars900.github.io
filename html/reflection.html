     <h2>First Assignment</h2>
     <p>The main idea was to create a interface which passengers could track the progress of the journey by accessing  informations about the spaceship and it's environment.</p>
     <p>I decide to incorporate some factors that was  on the assignment like fuel, speed, distance traveled, atmosphere, etc. Some others factors that wasn't on the assignment and I thought that people may like are a Countdown which gives the user a experience to start the travel whenever they want, Time to Mars which shows remaining time that updates every second so the user can check how much time is left, Distance Remaining and a Converter which gives the user possibility to choose between km or miles and check how much distance is remaining until the travel is complete and Current Location which provides the user with three status Earth, Space, and Mars so the user can quickly check where the spaceship is.
    </p>
    <p>The interface is interactive like the red button that activates the countdown function, the power control that shows a alert box and a km to miles button that activate a function that converts the metrics. I use  a lot DOM to access the objects specially the document.getElementByID and I didn't use any frameworks so it's essentially javascript.
    </p>
    <p>Basically for this assignment the most important elements that I used from javascript was the DOM that allowed me to access the html contetent and modify it, the boolean values that I set to some variables that allowed me to control when the functions should execute and the setInterval which gave me the possibility to call any function with a certain period of time. So with those elements I've created a interface that updates some parts of the html page every second.
    Regarding the design I tried to simulate a controls of a pilot cockpit that's why I gave it the round format.
    </p>
     
     <h2>Second Assignment</h2>
     <p>I've created a big Space Clock that shows Time of Earth and Time of Mars. For that I set dates in the future for the Earth and Mars. To cover the differences of length of day the Mars Clock runs slowly and to cover the differences of month and year I use the Darian Calendar. The Space Clock has 10 different themes based on solar system and the default theme is animated.
     </p>
     <p>The javascript code has 2 main functions earthClock and marsClock. The earthClock function use DOM to access the html element and display the date and time, this function has some if statements which add seconds, hours, month and years depending the conditions. Also it has a function that adds a zero if the number is less than 10 and another function to check how many days is in the current month. The marsClock uses the same concepts the differences consists that I set a array with the months based on Darian Calendar which has 24 months total. Also Mars Clock runs slowly to be like a earthClock which has 24h/day so the function marsClock is called by setInterval every 1.027 seconds instead of one second.
     </p>
     <p>The theme switching basically was made by a DOM which I set a event that when the user click the planets it will change the CSS styles so it will give a new look for the clock. Also when the user hover on the planets, using CSS transitions, it will rotate 180 degrees in 1.5 seconds and when the mouse is off it will come back to original position in 1.5 seconds.
     </p>
     <p>In the default theme has 2 types of animation. The first one use TweenMax which will rotate the Icon FOX 360 degrees when the clock starts. The second one use a event  in javascript code that on click will activate a animation on CSS file which name pulseClock it has a duration of 4 seconds and in each seconds it changes the border colors giving the impression that the clock is rotating.
     Regarding frameworks and libraries for this assignment I just use TweenMax, the rest is essentially javascript and CSS.
     </p>
     
     <h2>Third Assignment</h2>
     <p>This interface tracks the condition of two possibles landing spots. For that I used three API's Google Maps, Elevation and  Open Weather. 
     </p>
     <p>I started with the Open Weather that allow me to take data about weather conditions of any location. I read the API documentation to check in what type of data format I could request, so I choose to request in a JSON format. Once I have my API key and the locations I use the ajax method with a jquery to access this API. I wrote 2 functions the first one that on any error in the proccess to get the data it will write in a html div "An error has occurred" so the user will be able to see that something went wrong, the second one when it has a success I set four parameters that I think it's more relevant  like temperature, weather, wind speed and wind direction, so I put those data inside a variables then I use DOM to access the elements and innerHTML to pass it into a html page.
     </p>
     <p>The Elevation API also I read the documentation and this one was more simple. I just had to set a variable with a latitude and longitude and follow  the example. The only problem was that the output data was in this format { "elev": "number" } so I use slice method in my javascript code to give me just the number, then like in the Open Weather I use DOM and innerHTML to pass it into a html page.</p>
     <p>In the Google Maps API I set the javascript code inside the html page because of the callback function that this API require. So I set a function called "initialize" to set the latitude and longitude of the both maps and the options like zoom and the type of map that I want. To make it original I created a style called "Space Style" and make it a option on my maps. Also instead of the default pointer I decide to use a rocket to point where the pilot should land.</p>
