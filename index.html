            <h2>Transport System</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The purpose of this interface is to give information about the trip and to prepare travelers for upcoming arrival on mars.</li>
                <li>We will give you the honor to start the countdown. So whenever you're ready just press the red button.</li>
                <li>If miles is your preference, after launch go ahead and press the button to convert the distance into miles.</li>
                <li>Elon Musk in 2016 did a presentation about humans becoming multiplanetary species and of course how the human transport to Mars turned financially possible. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7Uyfqi_TE8&t=6s" target="_blank">Click Here</a></li>

             <h2>Space Clock</h2>
             <ul>
            <li>Space Clock was designed to track current time on Earth versus the time on Mars. The average length of a solar day in Mars is about 24h 39m which represents approximately 40 minutes later in Earth Time each day. This interface uses the Darian Calendar that was designed to serve the needs of human settlers on Mars. The year is divided into 24 months which is equivalent 686.86 days on Earth.  To know more about it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darian_calendar" target="_blank">Click Here</a></li>
            <li>Seconds on Mars Clock was adjusted to represent a 24hr/day like the Earth Clock, so it will pass slowly. To be more precisely 1 second on Mars Clock is equivalent 1.027 second on Earth Clock. </li>
            <li>To start or stop animation click the Fox Icon which is avaiable in default theme. Also you can try 10 others themes based on solar system planets by clicking them. To return to default theme click the title "Space Clock".</li>

             <h2>Landing Spot</h2>
             <ul>
            <li>This interface was designed to track the conditions of landing spots which includes maps, weather conditions and elevation of land which are importants factors to consider when you're landing.</li>
            <li>If you want to know how is the proccess to land the spaceship from space until Earth ground, a pilot from NASA gave a nice presentation about it. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jb4prVsXkZU" target="_blank">Click Here</a></li>
            <li>Locations that we're monitoring  were use as landing sites for spaceships in the past. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_space_shuttle_landing_sites" target="_blank">Click Here</a></li>
            <li>Maps are interactive and have a custom style. To switch styles between Satellite and Space just click in those options on the map.</li>
